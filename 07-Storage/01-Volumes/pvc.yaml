  resources:
    # We are requesting 6 MB out of 10 MB for the Persistent Volume we created.
    # However, all 10 MB will be set aside from the Persistent Volume for this PVC to use.
    # When a PVC specifies a request for 6Mi of storage, it indicates that it needs at least 6Mi, but it doesnâ€™t limit the PV to only providing that amount.
    # Kubernetes will still bind the entire PV (in this case, 10Mi) to the PVC, meaning the pod has access to the full 10Mi, even though only 6Mi was requested.
    requests:
      storage: 6Mi
  # storageClassName from PersistentVolume IS PRIMARILY USED TO MATCH THE PERSISTENT VOLUME CLAIM.
  storageClassName: ssd
  # Note - it's important to note that using selectors for PVCs is not a common practice, and it can make your storage provisioning more complex
